These projects are drawn from my free Python books, but since they only use stdio text, you can implement them in any language. I got tired of the copy-paste \"1001 project\" posts that obviously were copied from other posts or generated by AI which included everything from \"make a coin flip program\" to \"make an operating system\". I've personally curated this list to be small enough for beginners. The implementations are all usually under 100 or 200 lines of code.

Usually I'll just have a loop that prints \"Enter a number.\" and then \"That is not a number.\" and continues to ask the user. Or at the end, when it asks \"Do you want to play again? y/n\" and I'll have it check for a case-insensitive response that begins with \"y\", and anything else it'll just assume the answer was \"no\". These are learning examples, so I want to keep it simple rather than complete. You don't need to firehose the student with all sorts of programming concepts to teach them the right way from the start. They'll learn that eventually. 2 . which project best shows using python standard library only for file handling or simple db work These programs don't really handle files all that often since they're for beginners. If anything, I use pyperclip to copy text to the clipboard or read text from the clipboard more than read/write files. The calendar maker program is an example of something that outputs the ASCII art calendar page to the screen but also to the file. None of these programs reads input from a file. 3 . any example where you used classes or oop patterns to keep code organized under 200 lines I actually don't use OOP at all, since these are such small programs. I dislike tutorials that want to use the full kitchen sink of language features for beginner examples. It's far more common that students get intimidated away from coding rather than not being able to handle the material. In Chapter 15 of Beyond the Basic Stuff with Python , I have an example of a full Tic Tac Toe program with and without OOP. TL;DR: If you find yourself with a bunch of functions that you always pass the same data structure to, you should wrap up all of those functions as methods of the same class.","date_of_reply":null,"num_replies":0,"num_upvotes":1}]},{"comment":"me starting with an content based filing system as my first python project...","url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1nitzoz/comment/nenxwyf/","user_commenting":"T3RRYT3RR0R","user_url":"https://www.reddit.com/user/T3RRYT3RR0R/","date_of_comment":null,"num_upvotes":1,"num_replies":0,"replies":[]},{"comment":"Thanks for this great resource!

Early beta (beta version 1.0). What my project does: A protocol for live agent interaction with a desktop app to track network-wide agent state (battles, collaborations, reputation), so you can build MMO-style games, simulations, and tools. Target audience: Students, indie devs, and small teams who want to build networked multi-agent projects, simulations, or MMO-style experiments in Python. Comparison: LangChain and CrewAI are app frameworks and an API spec for serving agents, not an on-the-wire interop protocol; Google A2A is an HTTP-based spec that uses JSON-RPC by default (with optional gRPC or REST); MCP standardizes model-to-tool and data connections.

The real challenges are in architecture, deployment, and scaling. Current project: Multi-agent system processing 100k+ documents daily Stack: FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker Scale: ~50 concurrent AI workflows, 1M+ API calls/month What's working well: FastAPI for API development – async support handles concurrent AI calls beautifully Celery for background processing – essential for long-running AI tasks Pydantic for data validation – catches errors before they hit expensive AI models Rich ecosystem – libraries like LangChain, Transformers, and OpenAI client make development fast Pain points I've encountered: Memory management – AI models are memory-hungry, garbage collection becomes critical Dependency hell – AI libraries have complex requirements that conflict frequently Performance bottlenecks – Python's GIL becomes apparent under heavy concurrent loads Deployment complexity – managing GPU dependencies and model weights in containers Architecture decisions that paid off: Async everywhere – using asyncio for all I/O operations, including AI model calls Worker pools – separate processes for different AI tasks to isolate failures Caching layer – Redis for expensive AI results, dramatically improved response times Health checks – monitoring AI model availability and fallback mechanisms Code patterns that emerged: # Context manager for AI model lifecycle @asynccontextmanager async def ai_model_context(model_name: str): model = await load_model(model_name) try: yield model finally: await cleanup_model(model) # Retry logic for AI API calls @retry(stop=stop_after_attempt(3), wait=wait_exponential()) async def call_ai_api(prompt: str) -> str: # Implementation with proper error handling Questions for the community: How are you handling AI model deployment and versioning in production? What's your experience with alternatives to Celery for AI workloads? Any success stories with Python performance optimization for AI systems? How do you manage the costs of AI API calls in high-throughput applications? Emerging trends I'm watching: MCP (Model Context Protocol) – standardizing how AI systems interact with external tools Local model deployment – running models like Llama locally for cost/privacy AI observability tools – monitoring and debugging AI system behavior Edge AI with Python – running lightweight models on edge devices The Python AI ecosystem is evolving rapidly. Curious to hear what patterns and tools are working for others in production environments.

Python’s standard library is huge and covers so much, but sometimes it feels easier (or just faster) to grab a popular external package from PyPI. For example, I’ve seen people write entire data processing scripts with just built-in modules, while others immediately bring in pandas or requests even for simple tasks. I’m curious how you all approach this. Do you try to keep dependencies minimal and stick to the stdlib as much as possible, or do you reach for external packages early to save development time?

I have been building internal tools for 4 years and have used just about every software and platform out there: (Heroku, Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, Retool, Fly.io / Render / Railway), and they all fall short in terms of simplicity and usability for most teams. This platform would allow smaller dev teams to click-to-deploy small-medium sized programs, scripts, web apps, etc. to the cloud from a Github repository. The frontend will consist of a portal to select the program you want to run and then route to that specific page to execute it. Features I am looking into are: centralized sharing gives non-tech users an easier way to access all the tools in one location (no more siloed notebooks, scripts, and web app URLs) one-click edits/deploys (git push = updated application in cloud) execution logs + observability at the user level -> dev(s) can see the exact error logs + I/Os secure SSO (integration with both azure and gcp) usage analytics I'm wondering if this would be useful for others / what features you would like to see in it! Open to all feedback and advice. Lmk if you are interested in collaborating as well, I want this to be a community-first project.

The encoder transforms any text or binary data into a sequence of 3D cube models, each cube can have between 1 and 12 of its edges \"activated.\" (on the github page I have 3d renders posted), Instead of storing data as 1 and 0s, it uses a library of 217 unique, rotationally distinct cube configurations. The first 65 of these cubes are directly mapped to the Base64 character set: (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, /, and = (padding)) Encoder still has room to embed (potentially) more data: Base 16 (Hexadecimal) : 7.4% coverage Base 64 (default) : 29.5% coverage Base 128 (ASCII) : 59% coverage For any input cube configuration (a set of edges E), the first step is not to compare it against all 217 forms. Instead, we compute a signature invariant under rotation. Invariant Hashing is an efficient signature, the canonical form itself, obtained by applying all 24 rotations and selecting the lexicographic order, smallest edge set min(ρ(E)) for all ρ in O(24) . This canonical form is a unique identifier for the entire familial orbit. I got the idea from a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BrFKp-U8GI (very interesting!) Target audience would be anybody that likes to store data in a 3d enviroment.

What my project does: It’s a simple ML preprocessing helper package called ml-explain-preprocess. Along with handling basic preprocessing tasks (missing values, encoding, scaling, and outliers), it also generates additional outputs to make the process more transparent: Text reports JSON reports (Optional) visual plots of distributions and outliers The idea was to make it easier for beginners not only to preprocess data but also to understand what happened during preprocessing, since I couldn’t find many libraries that provide clear reports or visualizations alongside transformations. It’s nothing advanced and definitely not optimized for production-level pipelines, but it was a good exercise in learning how packaging works and how to publish to PyPI. Target audience: beginners in ML who want preprocessing plus some transparency. Experts probably won’t find it very useful, but maybe it can help people starting out. Comparison: To my knowledge, most existing libraries handle preprocessing well, but they don’t directly give reports/plots. This project tries to cover that small gap. If anyone wants to check it out or contribute, please feel free: PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/ml-explain-preprocess/ GitHub: https://github.com/risheeee/ml-explain-preprocess.git Would appreciate any feedback, especially on how to improve packaging or add meaningful
